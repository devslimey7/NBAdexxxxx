and the main guild will be: 1440962506796433519

the role id for admin commands: 1440962579051712642

admin panel username password will be

password: Jaffar69

and I'm attaching this screenshot this what happens when u set up the admin panel please make it 100 percent assesible and I don't need to tell u again and again make it 100% workable

and one more most important thing last time I made this u only made admin panel workflow I need u to make both workflows and progress at the same time like both should be running here and 100% accurate not only admin panel

and the most important thing? do it asap like don't take much time and waste credits like do it perfect and fast

and the last thing that u will do after everything and important:
this is a public command not admin this can be used by anyone anywhere
only do it when everything else is already perfect and set up this command doesn't exist so
add a new command (this is very serious so do it 100% carefully)
/nba drop
by this a player can drop a instance/card they have in their collection and others can catch it.
and when they /nba info that card it should show as obtained by trade with the person who dropped it cause basically you know what i mean...
when someone catch a card they drop themselves add like this to the message message:
You caught your own drop? What a cheap thing to do.

I am adding a screenshot of this command (it exists in a bit already so I am adding this so u will know what to do
make sure this command is 100% working and glitch/bug free do it perfectly
last time all the bot was set but there was a problem in drop command I'm adding the screenshot make sure there is no problem this time
